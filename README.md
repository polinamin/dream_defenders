## What should we use GitHub for?
Ultimately, that's up to you! While Notion & Slack are core parts of the Fellowship, GitHub (as well as Google Drive) are helpful but optional utilities for your team. Generally, we recommend starting off with whatever you know best. For pair programming and collaborative work, we recommend [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)! If you find that your code can't be condensed to individual scripts, then that's when to move your project into GitHub here! **What matters most is that your code & work is documented somewhere accessible to the team and to Bluebonnet, and linked from your Notion dashboard, but stored privately, .**

For any questions or issues with using GitHub, ask in the [Bluebonnet Forum](https://www.notion.so/Bluebonnet-Forum-ba18b7329b574926b7c5d777d5d3bbfc), attend [Office Hours](https://www.notion.so/Office-Hours-a724783df78a476981273daa855301a8), or (for IT support issues) email programs@bluebonnetdata.org

## General Git primer
### Realistically, you won't need to do much complicated with Github for the purposes of the Fellowship. Here are the core commands you'll need to use:
```
git clone [repository link here]
git pull 
git add . 
git commit -m "[enter message]"
#(or git commit -am "" to combine git add . and git commit -m together)
git push
